# MyJobApplicationProcess
### My Job Application Process (2022)

**Concepts:** Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Data Collection, Data Cleaning

**Software & Languages:** Python, Jupyter Notebook

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, datetime, matplotlib

**Description:** This was a personal project I completed for practice purposes after receiving and accepting a job offer during the MSBA program recruitment cycle. I was interested to understand the details of positions I applied to over time. I kept logs of each application I submitted in a Google Sheet which I then converted to a CSV file for the project. The data needed to be manipulated to add value to the visualizations. The notebook and job application dashboard are included in the repository.
